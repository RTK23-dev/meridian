# OpenRouter in Meridian

OpenRouter is used for five different jobs. They have different endpoints, different keys and different readiness rules, and they are not interchangeable. This page is the inventory: each place that talks to OpenRouter, what it calls, where its key comes from, and whether it is in use, deployment-only or a known overlap.

## The endpoints

| Endpoint | Used for | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions` | Structured decisions (the Decisions API). | Two paths, below. |
| `POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` | Ordinary chat. | `openrouter_chat` (deployment only). |
| `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (video, image and speech generation, through the engine gateway) | Generation: video, images, speech. | `openrouter`, resolved per workspace. |

A decision never goes to the chat endpoint, and a chat call never goes to the Decisions endpoint. A decision is never produced by asking a chat model for JSON.

## The keys

- **`openrouter`** is the workspace's own OpenRouter key. A workspace saves it in Settings, with its masked fingerprint, and removes it there. The deployment's key is used for a workspace only when `OPENROUTER_SHARED_DEFAULT=deployment` is set. The resolver (`credentials/resolve.ts`) applies this precedence for every caller: a usable workspace key, then the deployment key only when shared, otherwise not configured. No call is made without a key.
- **`openrouter_chat`** is the deployment's `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. It is deployment-only: a workspace cannot save it, and it is used only when `OPENROUTER_SHARED_DEFAULT=deployment` is set. Chat (`providers/chat.server.ts`) reads it through the same resolver.

A workspace's key and model never reach another organization. Every lookup is scoped to the signed-in workspace.

## Every path

| Where | What it does | Classification | Key | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src/lib/meridian/decisions/openrouter-engine.ts` | The OpenRouter Decisions engine (`openrouter-decisions`): one Decisions request per decision, typed answers read by question name. | **OpenRouter Decisions API, workspace-keyed engine.** | `openrouter`, per workspace | New in this change. Fixture-tested. Live call not yet recorded. |
| `src/lib/meridian/decisions/openrouter-settings.ts` | Stores the workspace's chosen decision model and the results of explicit connection checks. | Storage for the decisions engine. | none | New. Scoped per workspace. |
| `src/lib/meridian/jev/router.ts`, `jev/client.ts`, `decisions/jev-engine.ts` | The JEV engine. Its router names an OpenRouter route (mode OPENROUTER, `typesafe/jev-1.13`, described as deployment-only), next to TypeSafe Direct. **No code in this repository calls the Decisions endpoint for that route:** the only mention is in comments. | Declared intent, not an active path. | not traced: no key read for that route exists in code | Unchanged. See "Open decisions". |
| `src/lib/meridian/providers/chat.server.ts` | Ordinary chat (`openrouter`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL`). | Ordinary OpenRouter chat. | `openrouter_chat` (deployment only) | Existing, unchanged. It needs `OPENROUTER_SHARED_DEFAULT=deployment`. |
| `src/engine/gateway/openrouter.ts` | Video generation through OpenRouter's video API, with the reported USD cost per job. | Model/generation gateway call. | `openrouter`, per workspace (through the gateway, `gateway/meridian.ts`) | Existing, unchanged. The engine rule holds: no `fetch` outside `gateway/transport.ts`, and keys come from the resolver. |
| `src/engine/gateway/providers.ts` (`baseUrl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`) | The provider table entry for the generation gateway. | Model/generation gateway. | as above | Existing. |
| `src/engine/assets/providers/openrouterImage.ts`, `openrouterSpeech.ts`, `openrouterVideo.ts` | Image, speech and video providers. They call the gateway and hold no key. | Model/generation gateway, capability-gated. | as above | Existing. Each is offered only where its capability is verified. |
| `src/engine/config/routes.ts`, `config/prices.ts`, `gateway/catalog.ts`, `assets/model-choice.ts`, `assets/video-profiles.ts`, `orchestrator/*`, `ops/batch.ts`, `claude/*` | Model choice, route and price configuration for generation and orchestration, and the orchestrator's model catalogue. | Model/generation configuration. Not decisioning. | as above | Existing. Priced from the provider's reported cost, not from an estimate. |
| `src/lib/meridian/credentials/contract.ts`, `credentials/resolve.ts`, `credentials/live-readiness.ts`, `settings/provider-config.ts`, `settings/server-actions.ts` | The credential contract, the resolver and Settings. `openrouter` and `openrouter_chat` are separate categories. | Credential contract. | — | Existing. The decisions engine reuses the `openrouter` category; no parallel key was added. |
| `src/components/openrouter-decision-controls.tsx`, `decision-engine-selector.tsx`, `setup/engine-choice.tsx` | The decision model field, the explicit connection test and the engine choice. | UI for the decisions engine. | Shows masked state only. | New. |
| `migrations/0132_openrouter_decisions.sql` | Widens the engine checks, adds the model and check tables, and provider identity on decision runs. | Schema for the decisions engine. | — | New. Forward only. Earlier migrations are unchanged. |
| `src/components/content-factory/orchestrator-*.tsx`, `src/lib/meridian/orchestrator/actions.ts`, `src/lib/meridian/factory/decode.ts`, `src/lib/meridian/embeddings/provider.ts` | Labels, model panels and decoding for the generation and orchestration paths. | UI and decoding. Not decisioning. | — | Existing. |

## Open decisions for the owner

1. **The JEV router's OpenRouter route is declared but not implemented.** Its comments describe a route to the same Decisions endpoint with `typesafe/jev-1.13`, deployment-only. No code in this repository calls that endpoint except the new engine, so there is no second live path today. Whether that route should be built, removed, or folded into `openrouter-decisions` is a product decision. Nothing has been changed here.
2. **`typesafe/jev-1.13` is verified for text only.** Its documentation states no image support, so the engine refuses images for it.
3. **Score-level and choice-criteria shapes.** The request shape follows the documentation's published examples. A single live call on a real key is needed to confirm the shapes the API accepts for all three question types before the engine is treated as live-verified.

## What was not verified

- No live call was made to OpenRouter. Every test uses a fixture fetch stub. The browser check exercised the connection test without a key, which sends nothing.
- The reported cost is stored as the provider reports it. Meridian has no price for this engine, so decision spend records its cost as unknown.
