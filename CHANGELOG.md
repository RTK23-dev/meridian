# Changelog

## 0.1.0-beta.1 — 2026-10-06

First beta of the Meridian application.

- Brand Brain, market evidence, semantic clustering, opportunities, JEV, briefs, Studio, review, publishing clients, performance ingestion, and learning write-back are in the product path.
- JEV is the decision layer for opportunity, brief, and creative QA. Missing or contradictory evidence does not auto-approve. Calibration changes future decisions only after an admin approves a version.
- Image and video generation use the provider adapters. The xAI video adapter submits, polls, stores bytes, and samples frames. A status check does not count as a generated clip.
- Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, and Ad Library clients stay not connected until a request succeeds.
- Invites are stored. Email is sent only when an email API is configured and accepts the message.
- Local setup is documented in `docs/SETUP.md`, with `.env.example` and an embedded Postgres option.
- GitHub Actions runs tests, typecheck, lint, and the production build. The application is not published to npm.

Not in this beta: a hosted ad account, a verified S3 bucket, or a claim that live campaigns are running. Those stay external.
