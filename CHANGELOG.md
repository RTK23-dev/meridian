# Changelog

## 0.1.0-beta.2 — 2026-10-06

Video generation now follows an approved JEV decision into a separate Hypit process.

- Studio no longer queues `test:video` or `xai:video` for the production video path. A rejected or unapproved decision creates no job. A missing `HYPIT_BASE_URL` is `HYPIT_NOT_CONNECTED`. A failed Hypit run stores no video.
- A succeeded Hypit artifact is stored, then published through the existing publisher. A missing file, a failed job, or another tenant's artifact is not published.
- Test performance attached to that receipt uses the existing ingestion and `learning.update` path. It is labeled `test:performance` and is not a live ad-account result.
- A public page collected by the existing fetcher is passed into the next brief as untrusted text. The Meta Ad Library stays not connected without its token.
- Setup documents the separate Hypit runtime. Hypit source is not included in this repository.

Not in this beta: a live Meta, TikTok, or Google account, or a claim that synthetic performance is real delivery data.

## 0.1.0-beta.1 — 2026-10-06

First beta of the Meridian application.

- Brand Brain, market evidence, semantic clustering, opportunities, JEV, briefs, Studio, review, publishing clients, performance ingestion, and learning write-back are in the product path.
- JEV is the decision layer for opportunity, brief, and creative QA. Missing or contradictory evidence does not auto-approve. Calibration changes future decisions only after an admin approves a version.
- Image and video generation use the provider adapters. The xAI video adapter submits, polls, stores bytes, and samples frames. A status check does not count as a generated clip.
- Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, and Ad Library clients stay not connected until a request succeeds.
- Invites are stored. Email is sent only when an email API is configured and accepts the message.
- Local setup is documented in `docs/SETUP.md`, with `.env.example` and an embedded Postgres option.
- GitHub Actions runs tests, typecheck, lint, and the production build. The application is not published to npm.

Not in this beta: a hosted ad account, a verified S3 bucket, or a claim that live campaigns are running. Those stay external.
